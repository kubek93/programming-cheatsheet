## Bash 

### Running multiple commands in one line in shell

- `|` pipes (pipelines) the standard output (stdout) of one command into the standard input of another one. Note that stderr still goes into its default destination, whatever that happen to be.
- `|&` pipes both stdout and stderr of one command into the standard input of another one. Very useful, available in bash version 4 and above.
- `&&` executes the right-hand command of && only if the previous one succeeded.
- `||` executes the right-hand command of || only it the previous one failed.
- `;` executes the right-hand command of ; always regardless whether the previous command succeeded or failed. Unless set -e was previously invoked, which causes bash to fail on an error.
