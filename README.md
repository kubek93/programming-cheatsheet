### xargs - Using subshell with xargs and docker

> Returned text from first execution will be passed to the second command

```bash
docker images artifactory.mrgreen.tech/docker/gametek/sportsbook/sb-mfe:latest -q | xargs docker stop
```

### Usefull commands

```bash
updatedb
locate [file]
passwd
man [command]
[command] --help
```

### Update grub

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

### Manage users and privilages

```bash
-rw-r--r--@  1 kubek  staff  20484 Oct 18 15:28 some_file.txt
drwxr-xr-x  19 kubek  staff    608 Oct 18 15:28 some_folder
```

First letter says about `-` file or `d` folder (directory). Next are tell us about access to this specific file/folder.

| # |        Permission       | rwx | Binary |
|:-:|:-----------------------:|:---:|:------:|
| 7 | read, write and execute | rwx | 111    |
| 6 | read and write          | rw- | 110    |
| 5 | read and execute        | r-x | 101    |
| 4 | read only               | r-- | 100    |
| 3 | write and execute       | -wx | 011    |
| 2 | write only              | -w- | 010    |
| 1 | execute only            | --x | 001    |
| 0 | none                    | --- | 000    |

You can modify access using command `chmod`, fe.

```bash
chmod 0664 sharedFile
```

### Zip/Unzip files

```bash
zip -r filename.zip /home/folder/*
unzip html.zip ./
mv ./html/* /home/dazdyqephu/domains/ohsospecial.nl/public_html/
```

#### Commands

```bash
adduser [user name] #add new user to the system
cat /etc/passwd #show users
cat /etc/shadow #show users and passwords
su [user-name] #switch to provided user
```

### Manage networks

```bash
ifconfig #shows you network interfaces available for you
iwconfig #shows you only wireless adapters
ping [server-ip-address]
arp -a
netstat -ano #shows you connections which are running on you machine
router #shows you routing table - where you traffic is exit essentially
```

### Manage files (create|modify|remove)

```bash
nano new-file.txt
touch new-file.txt
gedit new-file.txt
echo "tekst" > new-file.txt #create file and override with text
echo "tekst" >> new-file.txt #create file and save text at the bottom of file
```

### Manage services (start|stop)

```bash
service apache2 start #start apache server
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 #run python server which is smiler than apatche and can be run in every folder
systemctl enable postgresq #run for example postgres database not only fot that session but also after reboot machine
```

## npm

### Packages installation flags for `npm install` command

`common options: [
    -P|--save-prod|
    -D|--save-dev|
    -O|--save-optional
    -E|--save-exact
    -B|--save-bundle
    --no-save
    --dry-run
]`

### Show installed npm packages

You probably have some packages installed globally already on your system. You can see them by typing:

```bash
npm list --depth 0 #for local project

npm list -g --depth 0 #for global npm

# or

ls `npm root -g`
```

### Print the folder where npm will install executables

```sh
npm bin
```

### Try to run package from the nearest (or local project) executor

```sh
$(npm bin)/package_name
```

### Symlink a package folder

[?] copy package from project to global npm packages

```bash
npm link package_name
```

## Git

### Popular commands

```sh
git branch  -a #show all branches
            -D #remove branch force

git branch <branch_name> #create new branch

git push origin -d <remote_branch> #remove remote branch

git checkout <branch_name> #swich branch
git checkout -b <branch_name> #create branch and switch

git checkout -b test origin/<remote_branch>
git checkout -t origin/<remote_branch>

git checkout --orphan empty-branch #create empty branch without any history data

git reset --soft origin/<branch> #reset unpushed commits
git reset --hard origin/<branch>

git reset --soft HEAD~1 #reset one commit back
git reset --hard HEAD~1

git fetch <remote_branch> #Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated

git rm -rf . #remove all stashed files

git commit --allow-empty -m "commit_message" #commit empty

git push origin <branch>:<remote_branch> #overwrite remote branch with local
```

### Tag commit and push it

```bash
git tag v1.7.7-beta.20 d43bab9
git push origin master --tags
```

## Bash

### ZSH and oh-my-zsh - Make bash more intuitive and usefull

> ZSH also called the Z shell, is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh), with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes. Since itâ€™s based on the same shell as Bash, ZSH has many of the same features, and switching over is a breeze.

Install `ZSH` and `Oh-My-ZSH` (freamwork for easly manage zsh - additional plugins and themes):

```Bash
brew install zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)" #install Oh-My-ZSH
```

### Add auto suggestions and shell syntax highlight

You have to install two plugins: `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
vim ~/.zshrc
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Now, you can add it to your zsh config file `~/.zshrc`.

```bash
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

### Running multiple commands in one line in shell

- `|` pipes (pipelines) the standard output (stdout) of one command into the standard input of another one. Note that stderr still goes into its default destination, whatever that happen to be.
- `|&` pipes both stdout and stderr of one command into the standard input of another one. Very useful, available in bash version 4 and above.
- `&&` executes the right-hand command of && only if the previous one succeeded.
- `||` executes the right-hand command of || only it the previous one failed.
- `;` executes the right-hand command of ; always regardless whether the previous command succeeded or failed. Unless set -e was previously invoked, which causes bash to fail on an error.
